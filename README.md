# CameraLib

A Python library to perform forward and backward projection of 2D coordinates in camera space to geographic coordinates on [ODM](https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/ODM) projects. In simple terms, with an ODM project at hand you can use this library to ask:

 * Given a pixel coordinate in an image, where does it correspond on the map?
 * And it's inverse: which images and which pixels in each image correspond to a certain location on the map?
